# TwOS-PC-LFS (Flower Plant OS Prototype)

## 🌟 Project Name: TwOS-PC (AzenoOS)
TwOS-PC is the **x86-based PC prototype** for the TwOS operating system, planned to be developed under the future **Flower** brand. This project aims to build a Linux kernel-based system from scratch (Linux From Scratch - LFS).

## 🎯 Goal
The main objective is to gain practical knowledge of how an operating system's core components (kernel, shell, filesystem) are assembled, and to establish the **ultra-light, fast, and customizable foundation for TwOS**.

## 🛠️ Core Features
* **Architecture:** x86 (For virtual machines and PCs).
* **Base:** Built using the Linux From Scratch (LFS) and Beyond Linux From Scratch (BLFS) guides.
* **Interface:** Development will start directly with a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

## 📝 Licensing Status
The license selection is currently in progress. The core philosophy will involve a **GPL-like requirement** to ensure that changes made to the TwOS core are contributed back to the community, while protecting the TwOS brand and commercial secrets (like vendor code).
