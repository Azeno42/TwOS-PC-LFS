## What is TwOS PC?

TwOS PC is an operating system based on Ubuntu, designed to be a **more modern** and visually stunning prototype for the future flagship operating system of the **Flower** brand.

Currently, this Alpha 0.1 version is being developed using **Cubic (Custom Ubuntu ISO Creator)** to ensure stability and a fast development cycle.

## TwOS PC Alpha 0.1 Features

The goal of this Alpha release is to establish a distinct visual identity and a better out-of-box user experience:

* **Modern Visual Design:** A sleek, refined desktop experience achieved through custom GNOME modules, themes, and icon sets, providing a unique look that separates it from standard Ubuntu.
* **Enabled Shutdown Animation:** The supported shutdown animation, which is often disabled in Ubuntu, has been activated to provide a smoother and more polished transition when powering off or rebooting.
* **Optimized Application Set:** **Firefox has been removed** and **Google Chrome has been added** as the default web browser.
